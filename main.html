	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how much time a certain algorithm will take
	as ccompared to another algorithm. It is describes as the function of the input size n.
	When a an algorithm is efficient as compared to another algorithm
	that means it takes less time to reach to the solution for significantly 
	 greater size of input</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> describe how efficiently an algorithm performs in terms of memory it means
	the algorithm takes less amount of memory space to reach to the solution
	space complexity is always measured in BigOh notation which describes the upper bound of 
	memory usage for example O(n) space complexity tells us that for input size n
	the max amount of memory is required is n unit spaces</p>
